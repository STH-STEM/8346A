## Seb Jensen

Seb started with VEX IQ in Year 6 with the 2016-2017 Crossover season. Ever since, Seb has been building robots, attending events, volunteering at events and even organising them. Since transitioning to the VEX EDR platform, he has began to host qualifying VIQC events for up to 30 teams. He is the programmer of the team, focusing on autonomous and innovative means of making driver control more efficient.

## Roles and Tasks

Each of us have our own strengths with building and programming, respectively. However, you'll often find us working with each other to overcome challenges so we can expand the breadth of our knowledge. By not limiting ourselves, we reinforce our teamwork and communication skills, which are essential to competing at a high level.
