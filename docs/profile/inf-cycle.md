# Design Process

The engineering design process influences the team at every step of the season, helping us to keep organised and work efficiently. It will be adapted and referenced by 8346A in the digital engineering notebook throughout the season. The largest part of the design process is the continual iteration of the cycle, and this will be demonstrated over the course of the season in our digital engineering notebook.

## 1. Ideate

The process of ideation requires an understanding of the challenge, exploring it and defining the goals with specification, and then formulating solutions. Every challenge has many solutions, although some are obviously better than others, and we as a team need to find the most efficient solution meeting specifications and time and effort constraints.

Part of ideation is exploring how others have tackled the challenge. We make use of and cite a plethora of online resources where other teams facing similar challenge share their approaches. We can take on board and consider their experience as if it were our own, and when we discover a new solution, we will endeavour to share this with the competitive robotics community.

We will need produce specification for the solution for the challenge. This focuses on what the solution will accomplish, before describing how this will take place. Both design constraints and functional requirements will be considered, and specifications should be ranked based on wishes, preferences, and demands. After doing so, we can determine how we will approach the challenge by listing a variety of solutions and selecting the most appropriate.

## 2. Implement

This is where the team takes one or more of their concepts from the previous stage and produce functional versions of them. In doing so, we can see how each concept functions in 'real life' and interacts with the rest of the robot and its environment. We will have made an educated choice, often with a decision matrix, and will be able to proceed with implementing our chosen solution to the robot.

We will document the implementation of the solution and our initial findings before any significant testing which is to inevitably follow.

## 3. Test

At this point, we will have implemented a solution and will be able to gather valuable data about how effective it is. We will be able to determine where or not the final implementation performs as expected and fulfils the specifications. Ideally, we should know how the robot will function and perform before we take it to a competitive match.

Should the solution not meet the demands set out in the specification, we will return to stage 2 to implement an alternative solution presented in the process of ideation.

## Iterate

The engineering design process is not something done once. We will be working through the stages throughout the season to tackle a large number of challenges from design to game strategy.
