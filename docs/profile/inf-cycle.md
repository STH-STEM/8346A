# Design Process

The engineering design process influences the team at every step of the season, helping us to keep organised and work efficiently. It will be adapted and referenced by 8346A in the digital engineering notebook throughout the season. The largest part of the design process is the continual iteration of the cycle, and this will be demonstrated over the course of the season in our digital engineering notebook.
