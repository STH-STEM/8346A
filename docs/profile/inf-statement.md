# Team Statement

8346A (“The Lads”) is a team of two 15-year-old students from St Helena School in Colchester, Essex.

We are Seb Jensen and Damian Rusecki, and between us are a combined 7 years of experience with the VEX Robotics design platforms. This will be our 2nd year participating in the VEX Robotics Competition, but we have competed at the national championship level when we were apart of team 17089A in the VEX IQ Challenge.

The VEX competition programmes, brought to light by the Robotics Education & Competition Foundation, consistently provide us with new challenges we can’t wait to tackle each year. All year round we are fixed upon breaking our boundaries through engaging with the various aspects of STEM embedded in the VEX Robotics Competition. STEM didn’t always have to be boring!

Both of us also spend time volunteering within our local VEX community. Between the both of us are numerous teams we’ve mentored and a multitude of events where we’ve refereed, commentated, and set up and down, amongst other activities. We’re committed to giving back to our community that does so much to allow us to excel. We hope to carry this forward through this season as well.

This season we’ll be trying our hardest to achieve our best results yet, and we hope you’ll see this reflected in our engineering notebook.
