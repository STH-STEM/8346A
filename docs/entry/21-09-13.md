The new season is upon us, with robotics club finally resuming following its absence due to the pandemic. The team are looking to start the season strong, beginning with an analysis of the game.

## Game Outline

The 2021-2022 VEX Robotics Competition season, **Tipping Point**, is played on the 12 foot by 12 foot VEX field with 4 teams per tournament match, 2 for each alliance, red and blue. This game features elements of gameplay similar to previous VRC seasons, such as *In The Zone*. Consequently, we will be able to harness the knowledge and experience of previous VRC teams to aid us as we iterate the design process. The aim of **Tipping Point** is to score as many points as possible by manipulating the game elements, more so than the opposing alliance to win the match.

### Game Elements

- 72 Rings
- 4 Neutral Mobile Goals
- 4 Alliance Mobile Goals
- 2 Alliance Platforms

### How do you score points?
